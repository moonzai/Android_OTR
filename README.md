Android_OTR
===========

This is just an example for Android OTR.

There are two project files which are as follow

1. otr_server: this is complete example, just install this example on your one android phone
2. otr_client: this is also complete example, install it in another phone, make sure to change the IP to your otr_server's IP address

As long as otr_client starts, it will connect with otr_server app, exachange keys, when session will get secure, it will inform you on the TextView

this is just an example application. I have pulled OTR4J library from the Xabber project.
